# Silicons
An icon set I made because I came up with a terrible pun

## About
Silicons is designed to be flat, yet detailed. My main inspirations while developing this icon set are [adwaita](https://github.com/GNOME/adwaita-icon-theme), [luv](https://github.com/Nitrux/luv-icon-theme), and [papirus](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme).
